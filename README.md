# Algorithms for flagging MAM and SAM
This post includes the excel-compatible algorithms which flag moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) by Weight for Height z-score and/or mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and/or the presence of bilatery oedema. 
There is the standard questionniare template which is designing for data collection using ODK for Standardized Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) which is expanded from the SMART survey. The algorithms for flagging MAM and SAM are embedded in the questionnaire, which will give automatic reminder of referral to the treating program when a child measured is identified as MAM/SAM via the criterion mentioned above.
